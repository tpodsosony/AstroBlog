I just finished chapter 3 of House of Chains yesterday and I'm back with another rant!  

To get things started, I would like to admit that I had a tear or two in my eyes at the end of the chapter.
Karsa and Tarvold's friendship really grew on me and finally seeing Karsa accept the friendship got to me emotionally.
Tarvold did so much for Karsa's growth and helping him in learning of the outside world, it's simply heartbreaking learning that
the two will have to leave each other. I hope we get to see them meet up again later in the story, and I will cherish those moments dearly.

I'm a litte busy today so I'm keeping this one short. Having a whole dinosaur skeleton in your tower is the rawest shit ever and Karsa getting
his shit kicked in was funny.
