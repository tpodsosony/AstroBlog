        Howdy! I'm Tal, a recent college graduate who made the crazy decision to make his own blog. A very original tale.
    </p>

    <p> 
        Being more serious here, I am someone who tends to love stories. Much of my obsessions throughout my life have revolved around movies, games, books, and DND podcasts.
        In the back of my head I always loved the idea of being a writer, but growing up and being at least mildy okay at my coding classes I ended up taking computer science and found myself feeling very stuck. 
        I want to at least give writing a shot, and I think the easiest way to do that is through blogging! I'll see what I learn and am excited to share this journey with any readers this site may have :).
    </p>
    <p>My current interests are:</p>
    <ul>
        {interests.map((interest) => <li class = "interest">{interest}</li>)}
    </ul>

    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

    {goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
