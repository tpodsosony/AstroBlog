        Howdy! I'm Tal, a recent college graduate who made the crazy decision to make his own blog. A very original tale.

        Being more serious here, I am someone who tends to love stories. Much of my obsessions throughout my life have revolved around movies, games, books, and DND podcasts.
        In the back of my head I always loved the idea of being a writer, but growing up and being at least mildy okay at my coding classes I ended up taking computer science and found myself feeling very stuck. I want to at least give writing a shot, and I think the easiest way to do that is through blogging! I'll see what I learn and am excited to share this journey with any readers this site may have :).
